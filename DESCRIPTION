Description: Implements a set of online fault detector detectors 
             for time-series, called: EWMA, TSSD-EWMA, PEWMA and KNN-CAD and 
             KNN-LDCD. The first three algorithms belong to prediction-based 
             techniques and the last two belong to window-based techniques. 
             In addition, the SD-EWMA and PEWMA algorithms are algorithms 
             designed to work in stationary environments, while the other three 
             are algorithms designed to work in non-stationary environments.
